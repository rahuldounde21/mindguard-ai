# 🧠 MindGuard AI  
AI-Driven Student Stress Monitoring System

## 🚀 Project Overview
MindGuard AI is a lightweight web application designed to detect and classify student stress levels using daily behavioral inputs. It helps students become aware of their mental health state and enables institutions to identify early signs of burnout.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Students often experience academic stress but lack simple tools to track and understand their mental health. This leads to burnout, anxiety, and reduced performance.

## 💡 Solution
MindGuard AI provides a daily stress check-in system where users enter sleep hours, workload, and mood. The system analyzes this data and classifies stress levels instantly.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend:
- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

Google Technologies Used:
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Analytics
- Firebase Hosting (for deployment)

## 🧠 Stress Detection Logic
Sleep < 5 AND Workload > 7 AND Mood < 4 → High Stress  
Sleep < 6 OR Workload > 6 → Medium Stress  
Else → Low Stress

## 🧪 Features
- Real-time stress analysis
- Firebase Firestore data storage
- Simple and responsive UI
- Hackathon-ready MVP
